-- ** OVERVIEW ** --
-- This code creates macOS Calendar events from OmniFocus tasks that are due today or in the future
-- In regards to runtime, all events on the specified calendar are deleted and then recreated


-- ** HISTORY ** --
-- -- Rosemary Orchard
-- -- -- Modified from a script by unlocked2412
-- -- -- If an estimated time is not set then the task defaults to 30 minutes in length
-- -- willjasen
-- -- -- changed "set start_date to start_date - (task_estimate * minutes)" to "set start_date to end_date - (task_estimate * minutes)"
-- -- -- changed so that only events from today forward are added to the calendar (decreases runtime)
-- -- -- task notes are added into calendar event notes
-- -- -- calendar events are only recreated if needed
